# ZomatoReview
Zomato has become a popular restaurant catalog across India. Zomato also has a developer API. This can be found at  https://developers.zomato.com/api . The objective of this problem, assuming that you are working for a restaurant, is to be able to get alerts(as fast as possible) when a user writes a negative review. Using the API endpoints available according to the documentation, pick a particular popular restaurant and implement a solution that will send email alerts on receipt of negative reviews. Negative reviews should be classified not just based on rating but should also take the sentiment of the review text into consideration.
